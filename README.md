# CSC 487 Project

Our facial recognition system is able to correctly identify Stephen and Josh, as well as differentiate them from other people in real-time with 99.9% accuracy.

### To run real-time facial detection/recognition ###

First: Install all dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, openCV, Albumentations, Jupiter, etc.)
Second: Open the test_model.ipynb file
Third: Run the first two Jupiter cells to activate the real-time facial recognition
Fourth: To see what images the model fails with, run the other cells in test_model.ipynb (These may take a long time), then look in the created directories
